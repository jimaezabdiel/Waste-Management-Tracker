            <h2>SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production Overview</h2>
            <div class="overview-content">
                <p>According to the United Nations, achieving sustainable consumption and production patterns is crucial for ensuring a balanced future.</p>
                <p>If the global population reaches 9.8 billion by 2050, nearly three Earths will be needed to meet the resource demands of current lifestyles.</p>
                <p>Recent global crises have led to a significant increase in fossil fuel subsidies, which nearly doubled from 2020 to 2021.</p>
                <p>In 2021, governments allocated an estimated $732 billion to support coal, oil, and gas industries, compared to $375 billion in 2020.</p>
                <p>These subsidies are inconsistent with the goal of transitioning towards sustainable energy sources.</p>
                <p>Despite global efforts to address hunger, approximately 828 million people were facing food insecurity in 2021.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, about 13.2% of the worldâ€™s food was lost post-harvest due to inefficiencies in the supply chain, from farm to consumer.</p>
                <p>This points to the urgent need to reduce food waste and improve food distribution systems.</p>
                <p>The trend towards sustainability reporting continues to rise, with about 70% of monitored companies publishing sustainability reports in 2021.</p>
                <p>This reflects an increasing recognition of the importance of transparency and accountability in sustainability practices.</p>
                <p>In 2022, 67 national governments reported to the United Nations Environment Programme on the progress of sustainable public procurement policies and action plans, representing a 50% increase from 2020.</p>
                <p>These efforts are essential in promoting environmentally responsible public spending.</p>
                <p>By 2030, it is crucial to provide support to developing countries to help them transition to more sustainable consumption practices.</p>
                <p>This support will be key in achieving the broader goals of SDG 12 and ensuring that all nations contribute to a more sustainable future.</p>
